Coda 2 - jQuery Custom Syntax Mode
==================================

This repository contains a custom syntax mode for jQuery in Coda 2. The mode includes the following:
* Standard Javascript syntax highlighting
* jQuery code completion
* A snippet clip set for standard jQuery and noConflict()

Installation
------------
To install this mode you must navigate to the Coda 2 install directory and copy the .mode file into the Modes folder.

Open Terminal and run the following command:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Coda\ 2/

Then, to open the directory in Finder enter this command:

    open .

When Finder opens, you will see multiple folders. Drag jQuery.mode into the Modes folder. 

If you would like to use the jQuery clips you can also add them here by dragging the jQuery.clips file into the Clips directory. If you use jQuery in noConflict mode, only drag the jQuery_NoConflict.clips file into the Clips directory, not both. If you dont know whether or not you are using jQuery in noConflict mode, you are probably not using noConflict - just use the standard jQuery.clips file.
